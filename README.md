# ECG Signal Processing using MATLAB

📌 Overview
This project implements an ECG signal processing system using MATLAB.  
It removes noise from ECG signals, detects R-peaks, calculates heart rate,  
and classifies heart conditions. A GUI-style visualization is also included.
 🔧 Features
- ECG signal generation and visualization
- Noise removal using Butterworth filter
- R-peak detection
- Heart rate calculation (BPM)
- GUI-based ECG analysis visualization
 🛠 Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Signal Processing concepts

▶️ How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Run `ecg_analysis.m`
3. Run `ecg_gui.m`
📊 Output
- Filtered ECG waveform with detected R-peaks
- Heart rate analysis plot
 📚 Applications
- Biomedical signal processing
- Core ECE internships
- MATLAB-based analysis systems
